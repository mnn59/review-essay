# Introduction

## First Parahraph :
What Breast Cancer is? Breast cancer is a condition where cancerous cells develop within the breast tissues. Several diverse forms of breast cancer exist, impacting both males and females. Breast cancer is a prevalent issue affecting many American women. Around 13% of females, approximately 1 in 8, will develop breast cancer during their lifetime. It's the most common cancer among women in the U.S., excluding skin cancers, and is projected to represent about 30% of new female cancer cases in 2023. A new breast cancer diagnosis occurs roughly every 2 minutes in the country. Detecting about 64% of cases at an early localized stage enhances treatment effectiveness. Expectedly, 297,790 invasive and 55,720 non-invasive breast cancer cases will be diagnosed in U.S. women in 2023, with an estimated 43,700 fatalities from breast cancer that year.

identifying breast cancer at an early stage leads to a decrease in fatalities caused by the disease.

(The most effective way to prevent a late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer is by promptly detecting it through yearly mammograms and other breast examinations. )

Breast cancer death rates declined 40% from 1989 to 2016 among women. The progress is attributed to improvements in early detection.

## Second Paragraph :
Annually, the American Cancer Society provides approximations for fresh cancer instances and fatalities within the United States. This data is drawn from central cancer registries that gather incidence information and from mortality data sourced from the National Center for Health Statistics. For the year 2023, it is projected that the United States will witness around 1,958,310 novel cases of cancer and 609,820 cancer-related deaths. Furthermore, we have created a comprehensive chart that breaks down these statistics based on cancer types and gender. Fig 1

## Forth Paragraph : 
Various breast cancer screening methods employed in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems encompass mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and thermography. These imaging modalities have been extensively investigated in numerous scholarly articles and have exhibited favorable outcomes in the identification and assessment of breast cancer.Mammography stands as the prevailing and extensively employed imaging method in breast cancer screening. The integration of CAD systems has been undertaken to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis based on screening mammograms.

Ultrasound imaging presents itself as another prevalent approach utilized in the detection of breast cancer. CAD systems have been harnessed to augment ultrasound imaging, encompassing diverse methodologies aimed at detecting, segmenting, and classifying breast cancer.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) serves as a potent imaging modality in the realm of breast cancer detection and diagnosis. The integration of CAD systems into MRI has been instrumental across a range of functions, including image reconstruction and the identification of cancerous lesions.

Thermography emerges as a comparatively less prevalent imaging technique employed in breast cancer detection. Although not as extensively studied as other modalities, the realm of deep learning has also been extended to thermography, contributing to the endeavor of breast cancer detection.

This article places its primary focus on the comprehensive exploration of mammograms, providing an in-depth analysis of this imaging technique. Subsequently, we delve into the realm of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, particularly their application in conjunction with mammograms.
