# Introduction

## First Parahraph :
What Breast Cancer? Breast cancer is a condition where cancerous cells develop within the breast tissues. Several diverse forms of breast cancer exist, impacting both males and females. Breast cancer is a prevalent issue affecting many American women. Around 13% of females, approximately 1 in 8, will develop breast cancer during their lifetime. It's the most common cancer among women in the U.S., excluding skin cancers, and is projected to represent about 30% of new female cancer cases in 2023. A new breast cancer diagnosis occurs roughly every 2 minutes in the country. Detecting about 64% of cases at an early localized stage enhances treatment effectiveness. Expectedly, 297,790 invasive and 55,720 non-invasive breast cancer cases will be diagnosed in U.S. women in 2023, with an estimated 43,700 fatalities from breast cancer that year.

identifying breast cancer at an early stage leads to a decrease in fatalities caused by the disease.

(The most effective way to prevent a late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer is by promptly detecting it through yearly mammograms and other breast examinations. )

Breast cancer death rates declined 40% from 1989 to 2016 among women. The progress is attributed to improvements in early detection.
